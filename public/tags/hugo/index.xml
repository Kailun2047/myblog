      <description>Framework This blog is set up using Hugo framework. It&#39;s a fast and flexible framework written in Golang, and is a popular static site generator. There are various types of themes that are avaiable for use in Hugo, and the one I&#39;m using is called m10c.
Hugo is fairly easy to get started with, and the basic use of it might only involve a few CLI command. Most of the configurations and contents can be edited by adding key-value pairs in the config.</description>
