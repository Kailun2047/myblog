      <h1 id="framework">Framework</h1>
<p>This blog is set up using <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> framework. It's a fast and flexible framework written in Golang, and is a popular static site generator. There are various types of themes that are avaiable for use in Hugo, and the one I'm using is called <a href="https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-m10c/">m10c</a>.</p>
<p>Hugo is fairly easy to get started with, and the basic use of it might only involve a few CLI command. Most of the configurations and contents can be edited by adding key-value pairs in the <code>config.toml</code> file. More flexible content management done through Hugo variables and functions in extra HTML files. I'm yet very new to Hugo, so hopefully I can dive deeper later while mataining this blog and share more of it here (stay tuned!).</p>
<h1 id="deployment">Deployment</h1>
<p>A common way to deploy a personal site is to use Github pages (<code>username.github.io</code>). While that cound be a pretty good choice, I decided to use <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a> as an alternative for two reasons: first, I had (almost) no experience in setting up and maintaining my own domain and I want to get my hands dirty; second, Netlify provides easy access to CI/CD, SSL certificate, etc., saving me some time to configure these on my own. Netlify is easy to use. There's also an official tutorial to deploy Hugo site to Netlify <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-netlify/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The process can be briefly described as following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign up on Netlify and bind a new site with the repo of your blog;</li>
<li>Purchase you domain and use it to customize the Netlify domain;</li>
<li>Set the name servers of your domain to be the ones identified by Netlify;</li>
<li>Set the deploy setting (base path, build command, publish directory, etc.) on Netlify, then build and deploy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Though we could follow the tutorial most of the time, I still made a few mistakes when doing it myself. Some of them are:</p>
<ol>
<li>When configuring the deploy environment variables, make sure to set <code>HUGO_VERSION</code> to be the version we are using (which can be shown by <code>hugo version</code> command). Otherwise the deploy log may show you the exit code 255.</li>
<li>Though we can quickly get our Hugo site to work locally, it might be rendered incorrectly on remote end. In my case I made three mistakes (make sure you avoid these!):</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>when adding a theme repo, I used <code>git clone</code> (Netlify dislikes this) instead of <code>git submodule add</code></li>
<li>in <code>config.toml</code> file, I used <code>http</code> at first instead of <code>https</code></li>
<li>in Netlify deploy settings, I used <code>hugo</code> as build command. But I had the status of my test post as draft, meaning I need <code>hugo -D</code> to include the drafts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fortunately, I figured out these mistakes and have this blog working now. So keep lerning, keep blogging from now on!</p>
