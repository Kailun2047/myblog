      <description>Recently I&#39;ve gone through the &amp;ldquo;Concurrent Programming in Java&amp;rdquo; course on Coursera. Though the contents involved are very fundamental, I felt it&#39;s necessary to give them a revisit since they are building blocks of more advanced learning in concurrent and distributed world.
Overview Overall, I figured this course followed a bottom-up approach. It first introduces low-level Java concurrent primitives, and then go through some of the high-level approaches that solve some of the problems when programming with the low-level concepts.</description>

      <description>Framework This blog is set up using Hugo framework. It&#39;s a fast and flexible framework written in Golang, and is a popular static site generator. There are various types of themes that are avaiable for use in Hugo, and the one I&#39;m using is called m10c.
Hugo is fairly easy to get started with, and the basic use of it might only involve a few CLI command. Most of the configurations and contents can be edited by adding key-value pairs in the config.</description>
